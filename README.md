# Mini-Photoshop
Our project ‘Mini Photoshop’ is an image editing interface where we  provide 10 features for the user to edit the image using ‘MATLAB  software’. The editing features include image properties, darkening  image, brightening image, increasing contrast, decreasing contrast, sharpening, smoothing, crop, negative &amp; rotate. The user is able to view  both original &amp; edited images side by side &amp; can compare the changes  in the image. The user has been provided a list of all features in the form  of a menu where they can select &amp; try any of the ten features for their  image.
